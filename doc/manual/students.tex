\chapter{Student assignment}

Students have to write a brief report of about 2-3 pages about the work done during the session. This report must include an analysis about cross-development environment for embedded systems and the main differences with a native environment.

The schedulabilty analysis proposed in section~\ref{sc:ta} must be included.
The report can contain recommendations to improve the assignment and personal opinions.

If you have made the proposed changes or any other, you should write them in the report and upload the code too.

Moodle is the selected platform for uploading assignment and the dead line is December 10th.
